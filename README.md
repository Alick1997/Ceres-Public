# Ceres Agriculture
Description: Ceres Agriculture is a cross platform mobile application developed with React-native. Ceres Agriculture aims to connect the agricultural and food and beverage industries in Dominica. Ceres Agriculture accomplishes this by automating mundane and repetitive tasks when a sale is conducted between a large-scale buyer and a farmer, and also by making available and displaying useful data. The data is displayed strategically to guide buyers in their decision making process at all times before an order is placed.

The longterm goal of Ceres Agriculture is to improve the relationship between farmers and large-scale buyers. This goal can be quantitatively tracked by the frequency of shortages or overabundace of certain goods throughout the year.
With enough data, Ceres Agriculture aims to become a statistical hub for parties invested in the Agricultural industry. Statistics and trends on the total supply of certain products throughout the year and on the average price of products throughout the year are incredibly valuable to stakeholders of the Argicultural industry. The database architecture of this project was built specifically to take advantage of this opportunity.

<h2>Status</h2> The project is currently in the last alpha stage of testing and development, and will begin closed beta testing soon.
